but sees the stroking
on the doll's leg,

126
00:07:42,443 --> 00:07:45,311

into thinking

00:07:45,313 --> 00:07:49,014
that the doll's legs
are actually his own.

128
00:07:49,016 --> 00:07:51,150
Ehrsson: And what happens then

129
00:07:51,152 --> 00:07:54,353
is the brain just fuses
what you see and what you feel,

130
00:07:54,355 --> 00:07:57,289

of your own body,

133
00:08:04,031 --> 00:08:06,031
and we think the brain does that

134
00:08:06,033 --> 00:08:09,802
by integrating all available
information from all the senses

135
00:08:09,804 --> 00:08:12,104

in a very sort of basic way,

153

00:19:12,732 --> 00:19:14,832
to perform a group task.

349
00:19:14,834 --> 00:19:17,267
So, this is
a team-building exercise

350
00:19:17,269 --> 00:19:21,171
to look at how you guys actually
work together to do this task.

351
00:19:21,173 --> 00:19:25,709
And the task is
take pages from a comic book

352
00:19:25,711 --> 00:19:26,844
and put them in the right order

353
00:19:26,846 --> 00:19:28,378
but without showing them
to each other.

354
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:30,881
So, you have to
talk to each other,

355
00:19:30,883 --> 00:19:33,183
you have to, you know,
figure out ways to describe it

356
00:19:33,185 --> 00:19:35,052
in order to
get it in the right order.

357
00:19:35,054 --> 00:19:38,355
And what we're also gonna do is,
while you do that,

358
00:19:38,357 --> 00:19:40,924
we're gonna have these badges
that we put on you.

359
00:19:43,561 --> 00:19:46,530
There is a weird, like,
spaceship in mine.

360
00:19:46,532 --> 00:19:48,298
I have the explosion.

361
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:51,668
I can tell you that
the flamethrowers did not work,

362
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:54,838
whoever had [laughs]
that other section.

363
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:57,474
Freeman: While the students try
to solve the task,

364
00:19:57,476 --> 00:20:00,744
the smart badges are busily
recording intimate details

365
00:20:00,746 --> 00:20:03,113
of their subconscious behavior.

366
00:20:03,115 --> 00:20:06,183
So, a lot of these patterns
are, indeed, unconscious.

367
00:20:06,185 --> 00:20:08,752
They're things you can focus on
consciously,

368
00:20:08,754 --> 00:20:10,187
but, normally, you don't.

369
00:20:10,189 --> 00:20:12,356
It turns out
they have enormous impact

370
00:20:12,358 --> 00:20:13,991
on the productivity of a group.

371
00:20:13,993 --> 00:20:16,660
Robots and monsters,
there's two different things.

372
00:20:16,662 --> 00:20:18,128
Oh. I'm robots.
I'm robots.

373
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:19,763
Maybe we should
clear that out.

374
00:20:19,765 --> 00:20:21,598
Does anyone actually have
a monster,

375
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,333
or are we all robots
here?

376
00:20:23,335 --> 00:20:26,069
Freeman: And though the task
has a clear goal,

377
00:20:26,071 --> 00:20:29,106
it's not the outcome
that primarily interests Sandy.

378
00:20:29,108 --> 00:20:31,141
Pentland: In watching things,

379
00:20:31,143 --> 00:20:33,944
we always get distracted
by the ideas.

380
00:20:33,946 --> 00:20:36,680
But what seems to really count,
in terms of performance,

381
00:20:36,682 --> 00:20:38,582
is the flow of information.

382
00:20:38,584 --> 00:20:41,518
Woman: I'm not sure
whether that is the first page

383
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,853
or whether it's after.

384
00:20:42,855 --> 00:20:45,556
Like, I could see either
yours as background story,

385
00:20:45,558 --> 00:20:48,192
and then we have, "Here is
your current adventure."

386
00:20:48,194 --> 00:20:50,460
Pentland: This is showing
who's talking to who.

387
00:20:50,462 --> 00:20:53,263
And you see that everybody's
talking pretty much to everybody

388
00:20:53,265 --> 00:20:56,667
except for maybe this one
person, who isn't that involved.

389
00:20:56,669 --> 00:20:58,769
These little yellow balls --

390
00:20:58,771 --> 00:21:01,171
this is how much "in the loop"
people are.

391
00:21:01,173 --> 00:21:05,509
So, are they part
of a loop of conversation?

392
00:21:05,511 --> 00:21:08,512
And that's important
because it has to do with

393
00:21:08,514 --> 00:21:11,348
whether people are on
the same page or not.

394
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:12,516
Yeah. Boom, boom.

395
00:21:12,518 --> 00:21:14,918
...resulted
from someone else's bomb.

396
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,086
And then, down here,

397
00:21:16,088 --> 00:21:18,455
this is maybe
the most interesting thing.

398
00:21:18,457 --> 00:21:20,457
So, this is looking
at dominance.

399
00:21:20,459 --> 00:21:23,327
So this is how much people
are pushing the conversation

400
00:21:23,329 --> 00:21:24,328
and driving it.

401
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:26,630
And the size
of the yellow ball there

402
00:21:26,632 --> 00:21:28,298
shows their dominance score,

403
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:30,901
and you can see
everybody's about the same.

404
00:21:30,903 --> 00:21:33,403
Their yellow circles
are about the same size,

405
00:21:33,405 --> 00:21:36,506
which is what you want for
this sort of brainstorming task.

406
00:21:36,508 --> 00:21:39,009
You don't want anybody
to be really dominant.

407
00:21:39,011 --> 00:21:40,744
You want everybody contributing.

408
00:21:40,746 --> 00:21:43,647
You want everybody holding
the flow about the same time,

409
00:21:43,649 --> 00:21:46,049
and that seems to be
what we got.

410
00:21:46,051 --> 00:21:48,085
I think
I'm actually here.

411
00:21:48,087 --> 00:21:49,887
Good.
Pentland: Okay.

412
00:21:49,889 --> 00:21:52,089
Oh, now we're getting rid
of the end.

413
00:21:52,091 --> 00:21:54,892
Freeman: Sandy has also
found a connection

414
00:21:54,894 --> 00:21:57,394
between a person's tone of voice

415
00:21:57,396 --> 00:22:00,264
and how effective they are
in a group.

416
00:22:00,266 --> 00:22:02,866
Do you have a blond person
and a dark-haired person?

417
00:22:02,868 --> 00:22:04,334
Is that the "scientist,"

418
00:22:04,336 --> 00:22:06,904
or are they a different type
of scientist?

419
00:22:06,906 --> 00:22:09,673
Sandy's studies show
that people who speak

420
00:22:09,675 --> 00:22:13,744
in a direct and consistently
strong tone of voice

421
00:22:13,746 --> 00:22:17,080
are perceived
as having expertise.

422
00:22:17,082 --> 00:22:20,217
Pentland: There's a sort of
practical type of charisma,

423
00:22:20,219 --> 00:22:24,321
which is being able to get
your point across convincingly.

424
00:22:24,323 --> 00:22:25,789
Then you want a lot of energy,

425
00:22:25,791 --> 00:22:27,858
people putting in
lots of contributions,

426
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:31,762
so the balance of contributions
and having lots of contributions

427
00:22:31,764 --> 00:22:34,364
are two characteristics
of really good teams

428
00:22:34,366 --> 00:22:36,633
in this type of situation.

429
00:22:36,635 --> 00:22:38,635
Everyone's got to
tell their story --

430
00:22:38,637 --> 00:22:40,537
real short --
lay down their piece.

431
00:22:40,539 --> 00:22:42,339
And then, at the end,

432
00:22:42,341 --> 00:22:44,875
we'll turn them over
and see what happened, okay?

433
00:22:50,481 --> 00:22:53,617
Freeman: The moment has arrived.

434
00:22:53,619 --> 00:22:56,086
Does their assembled comic strip

435
00:22:56,088 --> 00:23:00,057
match the correct one
lying facedown on the floor?

436
00:23:00,059 --> 00:23:03,260
Okay. Let's do it here.

437
00:23:03,262 --> 00:23:05,896
First ones.

438
00:23:13,972 --> 00:23:16,907
There we go.

439
00:23:16,909 --> 00:23:20,544
100% right. Yay!

440
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:26,016
Freeman: Sandy claims the device
has up to 90% accuracy

441
00:23:26,018 --> 00:23:29,820
identifying productive workers
and problem cases.

442
00:23:29,822 --> 00:23:33,590
Pentland: Individuals want to come across
in a way that's effective.

443
00:23:33,592 --> 00:23:36,059
You want to
have people trust you.

444
00:23:36,061 --> 00:23:38,562
You want to
have your ideas heard.

445
00:23:38,564 --> 00:23:41,331
You don't want to be doing
things that put people off.

446
00:23:41,333 --> 00:23:44,668
The science that we've been able
to do with this says

447
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:47,304
that it's not
sort of how smart you are,

448
00:23:47,306 --> 00:23:49,806
it's how smart you are
about other people.

449
00:23:49,808 --> 00:23:53,110
I think of it as
improving social intelligence.

450
00:23:53,112 --> 00:23:58,281
The subconscious is constantly
at work behind the scenes.

451
00:23:58,283 --> 00:24:02,652
Without it, we'd never make it
through the day.

452
00:24:02,654 --> 00:24:06,123
But could that hidden
brain power do even more?

453
00:24:06,125 --> 00:24:11,228
Some scientists believe we can
tap into our subconscious

454
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:15,932
to heal our bodies
and expand our minds.

455
00:24:20,141 --> 00:24:21,875
Stress.

456
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:24,277
It's all around us --

457
00:24:24,279 --> 00:24:28,782
traffic, deadlines,
financial pressures.

458
00:24:28,784 --> 00:24:32,352
And over time, it can
take a toll on our bodies,

459
00:24:32,354 --> 00:24:36,690
leading to sickness
and sometimes death.

460
00:24:36,692 --> 00:24:41,194
But what if there was a way
to reverse the effects of stress

461
00:24:41,196 --> 00:24:44,164
without the need for any drugs?

462
00:24:44,166 --> 00:24:48,301
What if our minds could heal us?

463
00:24:50,738 --> 00:24:52,138
Dr. Herbert Benson,

464
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:55,842
of the Benson-Henry Institute
For Mind Body Medicine

465
00:24:55,844 --> 00:24:57,110
in Boston,

00:24:57,112 --> 00:25:00,914
is a scientist
of a different mind-set.

467
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:02,883
He's on a crusade

468
00:25:02,885 --> 00:25:08,922
to show that sickness is as much
mental as it is physical.

469
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:10,991
Well, it's not all in your mind,

470
00:25:10,993 --> 00:25:14,127
but a lot is in your mind
that we can tap into.

471
00:25:14,129 --> 00:25:19,299
Freeman: In the 1980s,
Herbert trekked to the Himalayas

472
00:25:19,301 --> 00:25:23,203
to observe
how Tibetan monks chill out.

473
00:25:23,205 --> 00:25:26,773
At an altitude of 15,000 feet,

474
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:30,076
in a monastery as cold
as a refrigerator,

475
00:25:30,078 --> 00:25:33,380
the monks wrap themselves
in frozen sheets

476
00:25:33,382 --> 00:25:39,119
to practice an extraordinary
form of meditation called Tummo.

477
00:25:39,121 --> 00:25:41,087
Through meditation,

478
00:25:41,089 --> 00:25:43,223
Herbert observed
that the monks were able

479
00:25:43,225 --> 00:25:45,258
to raise the temperature
of their skin

480
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:48,562
by 17 degrees Fahrenheit

481
00:25:48,564 --> 00:25:52,599
while keeping their
core body temperature normal.

482
00:25:52,601 --> 00:25:56,770
Benson: Tummo is a form
of meditation they practice

483
00:25:56,772 --> 00:26:00,574
to do away
with negative thoughts.

484
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:03,510
And as a by-product of that,

485
00:26:03,512 --> 00:26:08,481
the body is able
to generate enough heat

486
00:26:08,483 --> 00:26:13,286
to dry icy, wet sheets
on their naked bodies

487
00:26:13,288 --> 00:26:15,755
and get them steaming.

488
00:26:18,693 --> 00:26:20,760
Freeman: It's still unknown

489
00:26:20,762 --> 00:26:24,331
exactly how the monks achieve
this inner fire.

490
00:26:24,333 --> 00:26:26,132
But scientists suspect

491
00:26:26,134 --> 00:26:28,501
the meditation
directly taps into

492
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:33,506
the part of the nervous system
that regulates body temperature.

493
00:26:33,508 --> 00:26:35,008
Benson: We were fascinated

494
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:39,679
on how far such
a mind-body effect could go.

495
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:41,815
[ Horns honk ]

496
00:26:41,817 --> 00:26:43,450
[ Baby cries ]

497
00:26:43,452 --> 00:26:47,721
Freeman: If meditation could
control our body's thermostat,

498
00:26:47,723 --> 00:26:51,458
Herbert wondered if the brain
also had the capacity

499
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:55,095
to cure our modern-day epidemic
of stress.

500
00:26:56,964 --> 00:26:59,332
Herbert believes
that stress stems

501
00:26:59,334 --> 00:27:02,369
from our instinctive
fight-or-flight response,

502
00:27:02,371 --> 00:27:03,837
which begins

503
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:07,907
when the brain's limbic system
releases a flood of hormones.

504
00:27:07,909 --> 00:27:10,810
A secondary effect
of these stress hormones

505
00:27:10,812 --> 00:27:14,948
is to cause inflammation
in cells.

506
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:19,019
If cells become inflamed
for prolonged periods,

507
00:27:19,021 --> 00:27:21,721
they can trigger
a host of ailments

508
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:26,559
like heart disease,
arthritis, and Crohn's disease.

509
00:27:26,561 --> 00:27:29,129
[ Groans ]

510
00:27:29,131 --> 00:27:33,667
So Herbert developed
an eight-week therapy

511
00:27:33,669 --> 00:27:36,403
designed to combat stress,

512
00:27:36,405 --> 00:27:40,840
involving 15 minutes
of meditation every day.

513
00:27:40,842 --> 00:27:44,544
He calls it
the Relaxation Response.

514
00:27:44,546 --> 00:27:48,148
To bring that
relaxation response about,

515
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:51,651
there has to be
a repetition of a word.

516
00:27:51,653 --> 00:27:53,453
Close your eyes.

517
00:27:53,455 --> 00:27:56,423
And you're gonna find

coming to mind.

and they should be
expected.

521
00:28:04,733 --> 00:28:07,367
And when they occur,
don't be upset,

522
00:28:07,369 --> 00:28:10,937
but simply say,
"Oh, well. Peace."

[ Thunder rumbles ]

526
00:28:22,149 --> 00:28:24,751
There's a quietude in the brain

527
00:28:24,753 --> 00:28:28,088
that occurs when you evoke
the relaxation response.

Did you notice any changes
in your body

while you were doing --

533
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:52,178
repeating the word "peace"
and disregarding other thoughts?

534
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:54,614
I did.
I just felt like a lightness.

535
00:28:54,616 --> 00:28:57,350

anything's bothering me.

Freeman: Before and after the eight weeks
of relaxation therapy,

540
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:11,131
Herbert drew blood samples
from his patients

541
00:29:11,133 --> 00:29:12,966
and looked for any changes

542
00:29:12,968 --> 00:29:18,104
in the activity of genes
that control inflammation.

543
00:29:18,106 --> 00:29:21,875
Benson: Say a certain gene
is being turned on,

544
00:29:21,877 --> 00:29:24,110
that gene will be red.

545
00:29:24,112 --> 00:29:26,279
These are the genes

546
00:29:26,281 --> 00:29:32,485
that control the inflammatory
immune processes of the body.

547
00:29:32,487 --> 00:29:36,189
Then you'll see,
looking at it afterwards,

548
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:38,391
that gene will be turned off --

549
00:29:38,393 --> 00:29:41,494
red on, green off,
so red to green.

550
00:29:41,496 --> 00:29:43,897
You'll see that change.

551
00:29:43,899 --> 00:29:45,965
Evoking the relaxation response

552
00:29:45,967 --> 00:29:50,069
can actually change
your gene's activity.

553
00:29:50,071 --> 00:29:52,405
Freeman: Herbert's study proves

554
00:29:52,407 --> 00:29:56,242
we can harness the power
of the subconscious brain

555
00:29:56,244 --> 00:29:59,112
to produce
concrete medical benefits.

556
00:29:59,114 --> 00:30:04,150
Benson: We now have
a scientifically proven approach

557
00:30:04,152 --> 00:30:06,920
right down to the genomic level.

558
00:30:06,922 --> 00:30:09,455
This will be more incorporated

559
00:30:09,457 --> 00:30:12,692
because,
not so much of the science,

560
00:30:12,694 --> 00:30:14,627
but also it's cheaper.

561
00:30:14,629 --> 00:30:16,462
This is cheaper than drugs,

562
00:30:16,464 --> 00:30:20,033
and it's obviously cheaper
than surgeries.

563
00:30:20,035 --> 00:30:23,970
Freeman: If our inner mind
can be our medicine,

564
00:30:23,972 --> 00:30:28,107
in what other ways could we
use it to improve our lives?

565
00:30:28,109 --> 00:30:30,443
One scientist has found out,

only to find yourself
hopelessly stuck?

569
00:30:46,934 --> 00:30:51,770
You know the answer
is somewhere inside your mind,

570
00:30:51,772 --> 00:30:54,006
but you can't find it.

571
00:30:54,008 --> 00:31:00,445
Perhaps all you need
is a jolt of inspiration.

Allan Snyder is the director
of the Centre for the Mind

573
00:31:04,885 --> 00:31:08,353
at the University of Sydney
in Australia.

574
00:31:08,355 --> 00:31:14,059
And he always has
his thinking cap on.

575
00:31:14,061 --> 00:31:18,363
I was about to get on a train,
and this girl gave me her cap,

576
00:31:18,365 --> 00:31:20,198
and she said, "hey,
you look so good in that.

577
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,300
Keep it."

578
00:31:21,302 --> 00:31:22,567
And that's why I've worn it.

579
00:31:22,569 --> 00:31:24,169
In fact,
I've worn it ever since.

Freeman:
Part comedian, part wizard,

581
00:31:27,041 --> 00:31:29,207
Allan spends much of his time

582
00:31:29,209 --> 00:31:33,645
thinking about the limits of
our problem-solving abilities.

583
00:31:33,647 --> 00:31:35,314
Imagine if you were asked

584
00:31:35,316 --> 00:31:39,418
to count the number of marbles
in this jar.

585
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:40,986
Could you do it?

586
00:31:40,988 --> 00:31:45,457
Snyder: Our minds categorize
things into concepts,

587
00:31:45,459 --> 00:31:48,226
and we're not so good at detail.

588
00:31:48,228 --> 00:31:50,595
We see the whole
and not the parts.

589
00:31:50,597 --> 00:31:53,432
We see the forest,
not the individual trees.

590
00:31:53,434 --> 00:31:56,535
But what would happen
if you weren't like that?

591
00:31:56,537 --> 00:32:00,038
Suppose you did have access
to all the literal details

592
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:03,008
in the world.

593
00:32:03,010 --> 00:32:07,846
Freeman: Allan thinks we can
access this cognitive power

594
00:32:07,848 --> 00:32:10,649
because some people already do.

595
00:32:10,651 --> 00:32:14,353
Autism is
a neurodevelopmental disorder

596
00:32:14,355 --> 00:32:18,423
that affects social
and communication skills.

597
00:32:18,425 --> 00:32:21,593
But 10% of autistics
are savants.

598
00:32:21,595 --> 00:32:24,563
They exhibit exceptional skills

599
00:32:24,565 --> 00:32:28,967
involving math, memory,
music, and art.

600
00:32:28,969 --> 00:32:33,772
Snyder: An autistic savant
is someone who has the ability

601
00:32:33,774 --> 00:32:37,075
to see the parts
and not the whole.

602
00:32:37,077 --> 00:32:42,981
They have privileged access
to unconscious details,

603
00:32:42,983 --> 00:32:45,784
unconscious processes
that all of us have,

604
00:32:45,786 --> 00:32:48,620
but they're beyond
our conscious awareness.

605
00:32:48,622 --> 00:32:52,057
Maybe genius requires
a dash of autism.

606
00:32:52,059 --> 00:32:56,395
Freeman: Allan has discovered
that autistic savants' brains

607
00:32:56,397 --> 00:32:59,398
share a pattern
of unusual activity --

608
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:02,134
impairment
of the left temporal lobe,

609
00:33:02,136 --> 00:33:03,602
a region he believes

610
00:33:03,604 --> 00:33:06,938
is associated
with pre-existing concepts,

611
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:10,409
and an overcompensation
in the right temporal lobe,

612
00:33:10,411 --> 00:33:14,513
which Allan suggests
deals with new ideas.

613
00:33:14,515 --> 00:33:18,717
Allan wanted to find
the inner savant in all of us,

614
00:33:18,719 --> 00:33:23,288
so he came up with the idea
of a creativity cap,

615
00:33:23,290 --> 00:33:25,223
a device that would mimic

616
00:33:25,225 --> 00:33:28,293
a savant's patterns
of brain activity.

617
00:33:28,295 --> 00:33:31,329
Imagine a device
that allows us to do, perhaps,

618
00:33:31,331 --> 00:33:34,666
problems that other people
have had great difficulty.

619
00:33:34,668 --> 00:33:36,601
We're going to show you

620
00:33:36,603 --> 00:33:40,372
a number of equations
made from matchsticks --

621
00:33:40,374 --> 00:33:43,408
Roman numeral type
of matchstick equations.

622
00:33:43,410 --> 00:33:46,278
And something's wrong
with the equation,

623
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:48,680
and you're supposed to
move one matchstick

624
00:33:48,682 --> 00:33:51,550
to make the equation
correct.

625
00:34:05,498 --> 00:34:09,401
One plus three equals four, yep.
That's it. That's the solution.

626
00:34:09,403 --> 00:34:10,802
Now let's do another.

627
00:34:12,472 --> 00:34:14,706
Freeman: Carl sees a pattern.

628
00:34:14,708 --> 00:34:20,445
By changing a Roman numeral X,
or 10, to a V, or 5,

629
00:34:20,447 --> 00:34:23,048
he can correct the equation.

630
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:28,320
Applying the same pattern,
he solves several more puzzles.

631
00:34:28,322 --> 00:34:31,957
But when presented with
a different type of equation,

632
00:34:31,959 --> 00:34:35,393
one that is not corrected
by changing a 10 to a 5,

633
00:34:35,395 --> 00:34:37,929
Carl is stumped.

634
00:34:47,373 --> 00:34:48,874
No idea.

635
00:34:48,876 --> 00:34:50,041
Okay.

636
00:34:51,310 --> 00:34:53,378
Freeman:
Now Allan prepares to give him

637
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:56,081
a jolt of inspiration.

638
00:34:56,083 --> 00:35:00,285
This cap sends a small
positive electric current

639
00:35:00,287 --> 00:35:02,454
to the right side of the brain,

640
00:35:02,456 --> 00:35:06,224
while a negative current
runs to the left hemisphere.

641
00:35:06,226 --> 00:35:08,360
The technique is called

642
00:35:08,362 --> 00:35:14,266
transcranial direct current
stimulation, or TDCS.

643
00:35:14,268 --> 00:35:18,136
And it's designed to mimic
the pattern of brain activity

644
00:35:18,138 --> 00:35:20,272
found in savants.

645
00:35:20,274 --> 00:35:22,741
Okay.
How do you feel now?

646
00:35:22,743 --> 00:35:25,343
There's a little bit tingling.

647
00:35:27,947 --> 00:35:31,182
Freeman:
After stimulating with TDCS,

648
00:35:31,184 --> 00:35:34,653
Carl tries
the matchstick problem again.

649
00:35:41,894 --> 00:35:43,895
Very good.
Congratulations.

650
00:35:43,897 --> 00:35:46,698
Snyder: This is a case
of mental fixation.

651
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:49,100
We can't help
but look at the world

652
00:35:49,102 --> 00:35:51,937
through the frames
of what we already know.

653
00:35:51,939 --> 00:35:55,707
We see a filtered view of the
world, not all the details.

654
00:35:55,709 --> 00:35:59,444
But Carl, after transcranial
direct current stimulation,

655
00:35:59,446 --> 00:36:00,845
was able to see the solution.

656
00:36:00,847 --> 00:36:03,248
Freeman: Allan's creativity cap

657
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:07,018
temporarily changed
the way Carl's brain worked.

658
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:12,958
It appeared to give him
savant-like abilities.

659
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:16,628
I can imagine a day
when we have creativity caps

660
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:20,231
that can allow us
to look at the world anew,

661
00:36:20,233 --> 00:36:23,868
free of our mind-sets.

662
00:36:23,870 --> 00:36:27,372
Freeman: But Allan's research
is only scratching the surface

663
00:36:27,374 --> 00:36:29,608
of the mind's true potential.

664
00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:34,346
This man believes the hidden
power of the subconscious

665
00:36:34,348 --> 00:36:38,450
can take us all to new heights.

666
00:36:41,045 --> 00:36:44,648
The subconscious mind
is more than just a storehouse

667
00:36:44,650 --> 00:36:47,451
for primal thoughts
and emotions.

668
00:36:47,953 --> 00:36:51,755
It's vital to our daily function
and survival.

669
00:36:51,757 --> 00:36:56,359
We know that we can harness it
to reveal temporary genius.

670
00:36:56,361 --> 00:37:00,263
But could we permanently modify
our brains,

671
00:37:00,265 --> 00:37:05,001
custom stimulate them
to be smarter and more powerful?

672

Michael Weisend
is a neuroscientist

673
00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:16,179
at the Mind Research Network
in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

674
00:37:16,181 --> 00:37:19,616
He has been drafted
by the U.S. Air Force

675
00:37:19,618 --> 00:37:25,255
to improve its most powerful
image processes -- human brains.

676
00:37:25,257 --> 00:37:28,391
Military technicians,
not computers,

677
00:37:28,393 --> 00:37:32,295
analyze the images
from unmanned aerial drones,

678
00:37:32,297 --> 00:37:37,133
looking for enemy targets
suitable for aerial bombardment.

679
00:37:37,135 --> 00:37:39,135
It's a high-stakes task

680
00:37:39,137 --> 00:37:43,940
where one mistake could mean
destroying an allied aid vehicle

681
00:37:43,942 --> 00:37:48,978
instead of
an enemy artillery truck.

682
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:52,115
Only humans interpret the data
that comes off of the drones.

683
00:37:52,117 --> 00:37:55,919
So there's a need for a greater
number of image analysts

684
00:37:55,921 --> 00:37:58,521
to look at that data,

685
00:37:58,523 --> 00:38:02,859
and we wanted to enhance
the ability of the brain

686
00:38:02,861 --> 00:38:05,528
to experience
and record information

687
00:38:05,530 --> 00:38:07,096
from the environment.

688
00:38:09,934 --> 00:38:11,935
Freeman: Computers
are not yet smart enough

689
00:38:11,937 --> 00:38:16,206
to pick out enemy targets on the
grainy imagery from the drones.

690
00:38:16,208 --> 00:38:18,408
Only humans have enough skill

691
00:38:18,410 --> 00:38:21,511
in recognizing
their distinctive shapes

692
00:38:21,513 --> 00:38:24,247
when distorted
by sunlight and grainy pixels.

693
00:38:24,249 --> 00:38:27,450
It typically takes
many months of training

694
00:38:27,452 --> 00:38:30,153
to become proficient
at this task.

695
00:38:30,155 --> 00:38:34,924
The trouble is we cannot create
enough experts quickly enough

696
00:38:34,926 --> 00:38:39,529
to deal with the demand from
the remotely piloted aircraft,

697
00:38:39,531 --> 00:38:40,830
or the drones.

698
00:38:40,832 --> 00:38:42,999
Freeman:
But Michael had an idea.

699
00:38:43,001 --> 00:38:46,502
He would locate the region
of the brain that is most active

700
00:38:46,504 --> 00:38:49,205
while the experts
were looking for targets,

701
00:38:49,207 --> 00:38:52,742
then he would use transcranial
direct current stimulation

702
00:38:52,744 --> 00:38:56,980
to amplify the activity in that
region of the trainees' brains

703
00:38:56,982 --> 00:39:00,416
and see whether
it made them faster learners.

704
00:39:00,418 --> 00:39:03,086
One of the things that's
quite obvious in the scans

705
00:39:03,088 --> 00:39:06,055
is that, when you are a novice,

706
00:39:06,057 --> 00:39:10,760
there's low-level activation
in the medial temporal lobes.

707
00:39:10,762 --> 00:39:14,330
But in experts, there's
very high-level activation.

708
00:39:14,332 --> 00:39:17,600
And so we targeted TDCS
at these areas

709
00:39:17,602 --> 00:39:22,071
that increase activity
in order to accelerate training.

710
00:39:22,073 --> 00:39:25,909
Freeman: Once the TDCS headgear
is in place

711
00:39:25,911 --> 00:39:27,877
but not yet turned on,

712
00:39:27,879 --> 00:39:31,047
the novice goes through
a half hour training session

713
00:39:31,049 --> 00:39:33,116
studying aerial photos.

714
00:39:34,351 --> 00:39:38,254
In the center is a red circle
that he needs to click and drag

715
00:39:38,256 --> 00:39:40,957
to any object
that looks threatening --

716
00:39:40,959 --> 00:39:44,727
in this case,
an enemy rocket launcher.

717
00:39:54,905 --> 00:39:59,542
This is definitely a pattern
recognition type of experiment.

718
00:39:59,544 --> 00:40:02,412
Here, where there are
yellow circles,

719
00:40:02,414 --> 00:40:05,548
those show the real targets
in the image.

720
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:09,085
Where there are red circles
with no yellow,

721
00:40:09,087 --> 00:40:13,089
those are incorrect choices,
and so, in this case,

722
00:40:13,091 --> 00:40:17,760
there was one correct choice
and two incorrect choices.

723
00:40:17,762 --> 00:40:22,198
Freeman:
Next, Michael applies TDCS

724
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,200
to the novice's brain.

725
00:40:24,202 --> 00:40:28,071
After 30 minutes
of electrical stimulation,

726
00:40:28,073 --> 00:40:30,873
he tries again.

727
00:40:33,844 --> 00:40:38,047
He now quickly identifies
five enemy targets

728
00:40:38,049 --> 00:40:42,318
in one image
without making a single mistake.

729
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:44,988
In the people
who got brain stimulation,

730
00:40:44,990 --> 00:40:48,958
every individual
was performing at expert level

731
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:51,694
after an hour of training.

732
00:40:51,696 --> 00:40:54,564
Freeman: On average,
novices who've had TDCS

733
00:40:54,566 --> 00:40:59,802
identify twice as many targets
compared with those who haven't.

734
00:40:59,804 --> 00:41:02,405
When he put subjects
back in the scanner,

735
00:41:02,407 --> 00:41:03,639
Michael discovered

736
00:41:03,641 --> 00:41:06,376
that the patterns of activity
in their brains

737
00:41:06,378 --> 00:41:08,511
are permanently changed.

738
00:41:08,513 --> 00:41:12,248
Their newly acquired skills
stay with them

739
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:15,318
even after
the stimulation wears off.

740
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:19,956
It's not hard to imagine where
this technology could end up.

741
00:41:19,958 --> 00:41:22,892
College kids could use it
for calculus,

742
00:41:22,894 --> 00:41:26,396
tiger moms for
pitch-perfect piano recitals.

743
00:41:26,398 --> 00:41:28,765
Just isolate
the part of the brain

744
00:41:28,767 --> 00:41:30,733
you need to learn a skill,

745
00:41:30,735 --> 00:41:34,504
and a TDCS cap could
make you a master in minutes.

746
00:41:34,506 --> 00:41:36,506
Whee!

747
00:41:36,508 --> 00:41:41,411
I've stimulated my brain
with TDCS many, many times.

748
00:41:41,413 --> 00:41:44,013
I've noticed this intense focus

749
00:41:44,015 --> 00:41:45,848
and the ability to concentrate
very carefully

750
00:41:45,850 --> 00:41:49,886
on material that I'm looking at.

751
00:41:49,888 --> 00:41:52,021
And I think it would be
a great benefit

752
00:41:52,023 --> 00:41:54,357
to be able to use
the tools of neuroscience

753
00:41:54,359 --> 00:41:56,292
to benefit people,

754
00:41:56,294 --> 00:42:02,832
to make sure that they
could perform at a high level.

755
00:42:02,834 --> 00:42:05,735
Benson:
As we learn more and more

756
00:42:05,737 --> 00:42:10,206
about which structures in
the brain are being activated,

757
00:42:10,208 --> 00:42:12,375
we can show
it's part of you going on,

758
00:42:12,377 --> 00:42:14,577
whether you're thinking about it
or not.

759
00:42:15,379 --> 00:42:17,713
Snyder: Much of what we do
is unconscious --

760
00:42:17,715 --> 00:42:20,049
our preferences, our prejudices.

761
00:42:20,051 --> 00:42:23,019
Someone back there
is guiding the show.

762
00:42:23,021 --> 00:42:24,220
Who's in charge?

763
00:42:24,222 --> 00:42:27,657
And I think it's the unconscious
that's in charge.

764
00:42:31,762 --> 00:42:36,332
Science has proven that
we really do have two minds.

765
00:42:36,334 --> 00:42:39,569
One drives
our conscious thoughts.

766
00:42:39,571 --> 00:42:44,774
The other is a shadow brain
that never stops working.

767
00:42:44,776 --> 00:42:49,145
It protects us from harm,
heals our bodies,

768
00:42:49,147 --> 00:42:52,949
allows us to think faster
and more creatively.

769
00:42:52,951 --> 00:42:56,886
We've unlocked some secrets
of the subconscious.

770
00:42:56,888 --> 00:43:00,790
When we finally tap into
its hidden powers,

771
00:43:00,792 --> 00:43:03,140
who knows what we will achieve?

772
